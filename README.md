# locopage

came up with the name on a whim. it's a spin on "local homepage" but also fits because my homepage is pretty loco, too. 

anyways, this repository contains my "local homepage" which houses all my usual links in a handy clickable format. 

it's quick and dynamic and uses a flat text file to store the URLs and data. it's driven by a PHP script which parses the text file and generates the HTML code.

help yourself if you want. my CSS skills aren't that great as the layout is kind of hacked together, but it works well enough for me. maybe some day i'll fix it up proper, who knows.
